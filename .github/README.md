# Counter Strike Deathmatch [ReAPI version]
# Description:
Players have an infinite number of respawns with full armor, and will
return within seconds of their death. Once the player is reborn, the
player will be invulnerable for a few seconds,this time will allow the
player to access the selection of weapons. Ammunition is infinite, and
any weapon can be bought (or taken from the menu), regardless of cost,
except for equipment like the C4 and the Defense Kit. The purchase of
weapons can be blocked or random, depending on which player chooses to
use. Once the player starts moving or shooting, the invulnerability is
removed and the purchase menu will no longer be available. Killing
enemies player will gain points, not money or new weapons. Also a
possible mode of domination (superiority of the enemy on points).
Weapons cannot be thrown away and players will not drop weapons when
they are killed. Fire on their own and collision disabled.
